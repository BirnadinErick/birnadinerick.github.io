As I twitted Day-0, I have decided to build a personal website; within the upcoming 100 days. Today, Day 01(Feb 23, 2023) I have finished the Feasibility Study for v1.0.0 🎉.

<p>As I twitted <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/birnadin/status/1628543481214914561">Day-0</a>, I have decided to build a personal website; within the upcoming 100 days. Today, Day 01(Feb 23, 2023) I have finished the Feasibility Study for v1.0.0 🎉. Took me some research on whether can I do this. Here is my report.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Operatioal: ✅. With a little bit of tinkering here &amp; there, I can operate it easily.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Economic: ✅. First, it is worth it &amp; got tricks up my sleeve to reduce cost.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Chronological: ✅✅. Since I am taking a vaca from all, this is the time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Apart from these 3 factors, I can manage others. That's a very short non-pro study by a Backend Engineer 😉.</p>

<p>At first, I wanted everything on my portfolio, e.g., blogs, projects, hire-me, e-shop(🤷‍♂️), my vlog, podcasts etc. But went <strong>zen</strong> and decided</p>
<ul>
<li><p>about-me</p>
</li>
<li><p>skills</p>
</li>
<li><p>projects</p>
</li>
<li><p>blogs</p>
</li>
<li><p>contacts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>are well enough for now. Anything can arise in v2.0.0. These key points will also serve as my <strong><em>functional</em></strong> requirements as well.</p>

<p>I will have the home page that has 4 main sections:-</p>
<ol>
<li><p>hero: about-me essentially</p>
</li>
<li><p>skills: what am I capable of</p>
</li>
<li><p>projects: what have I done</p>
</li>
<li><p>footer: where to next kinda</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Simple and sweet for now. The <em>global navbar</em> will contain links to separate pages of the site. They are:-</p>
<ul>
<li><p>home</p>
</li>
<li><p>projects</p>
</li>
<li><p>blogs</p>
</li>
<li><p>hire-me CTA</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, <code>projects</code> and <code>blogs</code> branch out to separate pages for <em>detail view</em>.</p>

<p>I didn't go fancy, just what I am comfortable with. I chose <a target="_blank" href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a> with <a target="_blank" href="https://tailwindcss.com">tailwindcss</a> because, after all, I am just Backend Engineer with somewhat non-pro Frontend skills. However I could have gone with <a target="_blank" href="https://flutter.github.io/">Flutter</a> which I am well comfortable with, but I don't like drawing onto Canvas which I could easily do with primitive HTML5 elements.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in the Feasibility Study section, for Economic, I figured some stuff up.</p>
<p>For DDos and Front Facing Cache, I will have <a target="_blank" href="https://cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a>. As host, I will use <a target="_blank" href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a> as it is less painful in the a** in my opinion. My projects' metadata will be pulled from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and the blogs will be from <a target="_blank" href="https://hashnode.com">Hashnode</a>.</p>
<p>the images will be <code>webp</code> and I am planning to use <a target="_blank" href="https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-vercel#incremental-static-regeneration">ISR(incremental server side rendering)</a>.</p>

<p>I think that's it for today. Till I meet in another one, it's <em>me the BE</em>, signing off 👋.</p>
