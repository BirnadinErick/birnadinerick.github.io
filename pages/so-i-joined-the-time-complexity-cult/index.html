<p>...principle. It's either <em>Space</em> or <em>Time</em> decision. You can't have both most of the time. Analyzing my case, <em>space</em> wasn't a problem. Because our "shared hosting" constraint had unlimited space but limited computing power. Thus-</p>

<p><strong>Static generation to the rescue.</strong></p>
<p>I know, I know, not that of a revolutionary. But, I have no other way. So I want to statically generate all the pages that the site requires ahead of time, <em>wasting some time, to save some time</em>. So, I decided to look for ways of doing it. It turns out there are many solutions, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gatsby</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nunjucks</p>
</li>
<li><p>Jinja</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pug</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But each didn't ring any bell.</p>
<div class="hn-table">
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>template language</td><td>why not</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Gatsby</td><td>powered by React, that's the root cause anyway ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Nunjucks</td><td>execution at runtime, just like react, interferes with animations üò¢</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>jinja</td><td>couldn't figure out how to integrate, something for the next major version iteration</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>pug</td><td>separate templating syntax, adds overhead for later-maintainers</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div><p>So, yeah, there are a lot, but they borrow from these and that's a no GO! Hence,</p>

<p><strong>Build a template engine from scratch</strong></p>

<h2 id="heading-another-template-engine">Another template engine ü§î</h2>
<p>Even though I could have gone with already available stuff, I don't wanna stumble again along the road just like I did in past years. Experiences Hurt ü•∫. So, I made up my mind to build a custom templating engine just for SPC's website. Now, have to think of how ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and what it should do.</p>
<p>Here are my problems:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Complex templates to manually edit for each page required, e.g. factory index.html had like 230 tags excluding the head tag, just the body ü§Ø</p>
</li>
<li><p>Later maintainers might be hauted by all the mess, hence suiciding themselves ‚ò†</p>
</li>
<li><p>If done manually, each blog post requires the writer to edit 15 tags, arrange photos, uploading to the server which the writer could spend writing and making üèÜ posts</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>So, my template engine <strong>should</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Compile the pages given and the writer's working area should be suitable for them</p>
</li>
<li><p>Extract common structures</p>
</li>
<li><p>Loops</p>
</li>
<li><p>Evaluate variables</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And some bonuses like,</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Conditional Compilation</p>
</li>
<li><p>I dunno, Ideas will come üòÅ</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>And, writers should be able to work GUI. With these in mind here's what I want to do.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Writers use Rich-Text Editors which can output html form text.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The output text is stored in a datastore</p>
</li>
<li><p>I prebuilt build a script that would run the template engine according to a <code>recipe</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Recipe</code> say how to parse templates that may contain <code>includes, vars</code> etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Vars will be mapped from a provided datastore</p>
</li>
<li><p>Parsed templates will be organized abidding the <code>recipe</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>So now writers deal with GUI then a double-click on the script(thinking of <em>.bat</em>) that will generate the site. Then, another build will run (s)ftp solution on the <code>out</code> dir and sync the server.</p>

<h2 id="heading-what-about-miscellaneous-stuff">What about Miscellaneous stuff?</h2>
<h3 id="heading-images-and-other-assets">Images and other assets</h3>
<p>One thing that our site is rich in is assets of photos. It's photos everywhere. My first plan was to host an S3 bucket with django. That <em>poof</em>. Then when I decided for <em>nextjs</em> I opted for Vercel's Image CDN which comes with Image Optimization. You know what happened! (If not then read the previous blog, <a target="_blank" href="https://fyi.birnadine.guru/when-django-nextjs-and-laravel-failed-me">When Django nextjs and Laravel failed me</a>). Then with Laravel, I was gonna go with the local shared hosting, but the server was busy interpreting the post-request-stuffs, not responding for assets download for a while.</p>
<p>But this time around, I decided to go with a separate CDN service. Not just separate, but free of cost and with unlimited storage. Along with mimic-Vercel Image Optimizations. I will go over this in upcoming posts. That also optimized for time, not space üò≥</p>
<h3 id="heading-build-time">Build time</h3>
<p>Static generation saves some time by doing work ahead of time. This is one drawback I see. We can borrow <code>Incremental Compilation</code>. Thought to later, Birnadin üòé.</p>
<h3 id="heading-dynamic-bits-of-the-site">Dynamic bits of the site</h3>
<p>Now that we are static, we can't utilize any dynamic behavior that might personalize the site for users. Our website has comments and an account feature. These sure require some server interaction in real-time. I am thinking about <code>pseudo-react</code> like operation. I dunno right now, but I will figure it out. If you have any suggestions please leave a comment publicly or privately. Open to ideas.</p>
